Color Picker
===========

Color picker plugin for LightTable.

Current version: 0.0.3

##What is this?

It's a plugin for LightTable that lets you open a small color picker tool so you can embed your HTML-compatible color codes into your code without having to look for color codes on the internet.

##How do I use it?

Add it to your plugin list (soon on the plugin manager, else clone this repo in your LightTable plugin directory) and then hit ctrl+space (or command for you mac users) and type "open color picker".

After you have selected your choice of color, it will close and insert the color on your cursor.

####Further developments

Maybe have it read already-existing color codes in the editor and show them on screen, eventually... one day.
